# Welcome to FormulaGo!

FormulaGo is an app designed to help students so that they can have a multitude of formulas ready for them at their fingertips. Formulas will range from basic mathematical formulas to complex Calculus ones! With FormulaGo you can search for a formula and it will display the formula you want along with what each variable is for. Or you can have a list of all the formulas be shown and then select the desired formula from there.

## Functions
- main() is the start of the program.
- mainMenu() is the main menu for the app.
- searchFormulas() is the searching option to find a formula.
- formulas() lists the formulas in FormulaGo.
- aboutFormulaGo() gives a short description of FormulaGo.
- contactUs() gives "info" to contact the devs (me).
- displayFormulaInfo(int, bool) will display the selected formula from either the search or the list functions.
- newScreen() prints 50 blank lines so it looks like a blank screen.
- goBack() goes back to the main menu once you are done inputting formulas to look up.
