# Welcome to FormulaGo!

FormulaGo is an app designed to help students so that they can have a multitude of formulas ready for them at their fingertips. Formulas will range from basic mathematical formulas to complex Calculus ones! With FormulaGo you can search for a formula and it will display the formula you want along with what each variable is for. Or you can have a list of all the formulas be shown and then select the desired formula from there.

## Functions
- **main()** is the start of the program.
- **mainMenu()** is the main menu for the app.
- **searchFormulas()** is the searching option to find a formula.
- **formulas()** lists the formulas in FormulaGo.
- **aboutFormulaGo()** gives a short description of FormulaGo.
- **contactUs()** gives "info" to contact the devs (me).
- **displayFormulaInfo(int, bool)** will display the selected formula from either the search or the list functions.
- **newScreen()** prints 50 blank lines so it looks like a blank screen.
- **goBack()** goes back to the main menu once you are done inputting formulas to look up.
